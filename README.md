# Code and Dataset for CS-725 Autumn 2019 Course Project.
The codes were run using Google Colab. The Dataset used and the code both are present in the repository. The code might not run properly locally, as the directory structure used was different while training in Colab environment. Also the graph generation part and confusion matrix generation part was handled differently by changing the data path for each case separately and is hence not automated completely using code. Still the snippets used are present in the code.
